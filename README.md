# Nagi

## A simple meditation timer

---

Nagi means calm in Japanese. Many of our lives are impacted by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, mental health is something often overlooked or neglected when there appears to be other anxiety-inducing events, such as shelter-in-place orders and furloughs/lay-offs. I found meditation to be helpful during these times as it allows me to clear my head and ease some of the anxieties.

This app contains some basic tips and guide on how to meditate, as well as a selection of short timers to get the user started on this healthy practice. The timer comes with an audio track of some nature sounds should the user choose to enable it.

I hope this app can help those who try to get into meditation.

Stay happy and healthy!
